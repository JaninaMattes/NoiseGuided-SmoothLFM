# ðŸš€ NoiseGuided-SmoothLFM

**NoiseGuided-SmoothLFM** is a framework for learning **noise-guided latent smoothness** in image generation.  
It builds on top of **Image Latent Diffusion Model** ([image-ldm](https://github.com/joh-schb/image-ldm)) and leverages the power of 


**Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT)** ([SiT](https://github.com/willisma/SiT)).

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights

- âœ… Uses **pre-trained SiT (Scalable Interpolant Transformers)** as the backbone, which are built on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
- ðŸ§Š Employs **smoothness constraints** in the latent space for better editing, interpolation, and stability.
- ðŸ”¬ Includes advanced quantitative evaluations: PCA projections, linear probes, UMAP visualizations, and smoothness metrics (ISTD, LDPL).
- ðŸ“ˆ Integrated support for FID, Inception Score, LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR, and custom smoothness metrics.
- ðŸ’¥ Supports advanced ODE-based sampling via `torchdiffeq`.
